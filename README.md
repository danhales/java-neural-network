# java-neural-network
A neural network package built from scratch in Java

I'm building this package from the ground up to get my Java up and running again after completing Flatiron's Data Science program in python

The goal is to dive deeper into the internals of neural networks, to really understand how they're doing what they're doing.

As of 9/15/20:

## test
The `test` directory contains files for testing.

## activationfunction
Contains `ActivationFunction` interface and implementations `LinearActivationFunction`, `IdentityActivationFunction`, `ParametricReLUActivationFunction`, `ReLUActivationFunction`, `LeakyReLUActivationFunction`, `SigmoidActivationFunction`, `TanhActivationFunction`, `SwishActivationFunction`

TODO as of 9/15/20: Uh... stop pushing those class files. I think I've got enough activation functions. Time to start building a Neuron!

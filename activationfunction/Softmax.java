/**
 * SoftmaxFunction class is technically an activation function, but does not
 * implement the ActivationFunction interface. It is a utility class that provides
 * softmax functionality wherever it might be needed.
 * 
 * For a vector X, we define:
 * denominator(X) = sum(exp(X[i])), the sum of all entries in X, exponentiated
 * softmax(X) = { exp(X[i]) / denominator(X)  for i = 0, 1, ..., X.length - 1}
 *
 * The output of softmax is a vector whose entries are a probability distribution
 * over the classes, i.e. output[0] represents the probability of the input
 * corresponding to the first class, output[1] represents the probability of the
 * input corresponding to the second class, and so on.
 *
 * TODO: Add method for getting the partial derivatives for backpropagation.

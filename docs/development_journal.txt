Development Journal

My thoughts on the project, as I encounter them.

Admittedly, I didn't get a whole lot done today. I realized that Softmax was not
working properly and spent a while debugging that. It turns out I accidentally
divided outputs[i] / denominator instead of inputs[i] / denominator, which meant
that all predictions were defaulting to 0.0 (the default value in outputs array).
Fortunately, I got that working. Testing ClassificationLayer shows that it is
currently choosing the correct label, meaning Softmax is returning the right
index.

That said, I should really McGyver a way to control the weights in the Neurons
better for reproducibility in testing. As of right now, they're randomized
initially and buried within private fields, so I'll need to add in some 
mutators to allow me to create predictable results.

I feel bad for getting a week into this project before realizing I should start this
development journal, but here we are. Before today, I had initial versions of

ActivationFunction interface
IdentityActivationFunction class
LeakyReLUActivationFunction class
LinearActivationFunction class
ParametricReLUActivationFunction class
ReLUActivationFunction class
SigmoidActivationFunction class
StepActivationFunction class
SwishActivationFunction class
TanhActivationFunction class
Neuron (previously called Perceptron, which I'll rewrite as its own class later) class
DenseLayer class

Hit a snag today. I was hoping to make all of my Layers include an ActivationFunction,
but the SoftmaxActivationFunction has a different method signature. It returns an array
of doubles (the probabilities of the input corresponding to that entry's class), but
the ActivationFunction interface requires a double as a return value.

Current plan is to just roll with it and retool Softmax into its own layer, instead of
an activation function. The reasoning is that Softmax is rarely used as the activation
function in a hidden layer, and the classification layer at the end has some additional
things to do, on top of simply computing an output value.

I recognize that this is something that will need to get retooled later, but I'm
hoping to continue making progress for now!

Pushed past midnight so now I have an empty square on my dashboard :(
